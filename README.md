### 🛒 About the Project
  - The E-commerce Application is a full-stack web project designed to simulate a real-world online shopping experience. It combines a modern frontend with a robust backend, demonstrating how client-side applications can be built, bundled, and served directly by a server.
  - This project was created while learning full-stack development, with a strong focus on application structure, API handling, and production-ready builds.

### 🏗️ Application Architecture
  - The project is divided into client and server directories.
  - The client directory contains the frontend application.
  - Running the frontend build process generates production-ready assets, which are placed into the server’s public directory.
  - The server directory handles:
    - API logic
    - Database operations
    - Serving static frontend files
  - This setup mimics how real-world full-stack applications are deployed.
